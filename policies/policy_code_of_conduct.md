# Code of Business Conduct & Ethics

## 1. Introduction
Our reputation depends on the conduct of our employees. This Code sets forth the standards of business conduct and ethics that apply to all employees, officers, and directors of the company. We expect everyone to act with the highest standards of integrity.

## 2. Respect and Dignity
- **Anti-Harassment**: We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment, discrimination, or bullying based on race, color, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or any other protected status. This includes verbal, physical, and visual conduct that creates an intimidating, offensive, or hostile work environment.
- **Inclusion**: We are committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace where everyone feels valued and heard.

## 3. Conflicts of Interest
- **Definition**: A conflict of interest occurs when a personal interest interferes, or appears to interfere, with the interests of the company.
- **Outside Employment**: Employees may not engage in outside employment (moonlighting) for competitors, customers, or suppliers. Side projects must not conflict with company business or use company resources.
- **Financial Interests**: Employees must disclose any significant financial interest in a competitor, supplier, or customer.
- **Gifts and Entertainment**: Accepting gifts, meals, or entertainment that could influence business decisions is prohibited. Gifts with a value of over $50 must be declined or surrendered to HR for charity.

## 4. Integrity in Business Dealings
- **Fair Competition**: We compete solely on the merits of our products and services. We do not enter into agreements with competitors to fix prices, divide markets, or rig bids.
- **Anti-Bribery**: We strictly prohibit bribery and corruption. Employees must never offer, promise, or give anything of value to a government official or private party to gain an improper business advantage. Compliance with the FCPA and UK Bribery Act is mandatory.

## 5. Protection of Company Assets
- **Intellectual Property**: All IP created by employees during the course of employment belongs to the company. Employees must protect trade secrets and proprietary information.
- **Physical Assets**: Company equipment should be used for business purposes. Incidental personal use is permitted if it does not interfere with work or violate policies.
- **Cybersecurity**: Employees are the first line of defense. Phishing attempts should be reported. Passwords must never be shared.

## 6. Financial Integrity
- **Books and Records**: All financial transactions must be recorded accurately, completely, and in a timely manner. Making false or misleading entries is grounds for immediate termination.
- **Insider Trading**: Employees who possess material non-public information about the company or its partners must not trade securities or tip others to do so.

## 7. Reporting Violations
- **Speak Up**: If you see something, say something. Employees are encouraged to report known or suspected violations of this Code.
- **Channels**: Reports can be made to your manager, HR, Legal, or anonymously via the Ethics Hotline.
- **Non-Retaliation**: The company strictly prohibits retaliation against any employee who reports a concern in good faith. Retaliation is itself a violation of this Code.

Violations of this Code will result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and potential legal action.
