# Global Expense & Travel Policy

## 1. Principle
The company reimburses employees for necessary and reasonable business expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. Employees are expected to exercise good judgment and act as responsible stewards of company funds, spending as they would their own money.

## 2. Air Travel
- **Booking**: All air travel must be booked through the corporate travel portal (Egencia/Concur) at least 14 days in advance whenever possible to secure the best rates.
- **Class of Service**:
    - **Economy Class**: The standard for all domestic flights and international flights with a duration of less than 6 hours.
    - **Premium Economy**: Permitted for flights between 6 and 10 hours.
    - **Business Class**: Permitted for international flights with a duration exceeding 10 hours (excluding layovers).
    - **First Class**: Not reimbursable under any circumstances.
- **Ancillary Fees**: Reasonable baggage fees (1 checked bag) are reimbursable. Wi-Fi on flights is reimbursable if work is required.

## 3. Ground Transportation
- **Ride Sharing/Taxis**: Uber/Lyft or standard taxis are preferred for airport transfers and local travel. Luxury services (Uber Black, etc.) are only permitted if no other option is available or for client transport.
- **Car Rentals**: Permitted for trips where ride-sharing is cost-prohibitive or impractical. Compact or Intermediate class cars should be booked. Insurance should be declined as the corporate policy covers rentals.
- **Personal Car Usage**: Mileage is reimbursed at the current IRS (or local tax authority) standard rate. Gas is not reimbursed separately for personal cars; it is covered by the mileage rate.

## 4. Lodging
- **Hotels**: Standard rooms in business-class hotels (e.g., Marriott, Hilton, Hyatt) are preferred. The nightly cap is $250 in standard cities and $350 in high-cost cities (NY, London, SF, Tokyo, etc.).
- **Airbnb/Vrbo**: Permitted if the cost is lower than a comparable hotel and safety standards are met.
- **Laundry**: Reasonable laundry expenses are reimbursable for trips exceeding 5 nights.

## 5. Meals and Entertainment
- **Per Diem**: Employees may claim actual expenses up to a daily limit of $75 for full days of travel. This covers breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- **Client Meals**: Reasonable expenses for client entertainment are reimbursable. A list of attendees and the business purpose must be documented.
    - **Limits**: Up to $100 per person. VP approval is required for amounts exceeding $200 per person.
- **Alcohol**: A moderate amount of alcohol with dinner is reimbursable. Excessive drinking is strictly prohibited and will not be reimbursed.

## 6. Non-Reimbursable Expenses
