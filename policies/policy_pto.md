# Paid Time Off (PTO) & Leave Policy

## 1. Overview
We believe in the importance of rest and relaxation for our employees' well-being. This policy covers vacation, sick leave, and personal time.

## 2. Accrual Schedule
- **Full-Time Employees**: Accrue PTO based on years of service:
    - **0-2 Years**: 20 days per year (1.67 days/month).
    - **3-5 Years**: 25 days per year (2.08 days/month).
    - **5+ Years**: 30 days per year (2.5 days/month).
- **Part-Time Employees**: Accrue PTO on a pro-rata basis.
- **Accrual Cap**: Once an employee reaches 1.5x their annual entitlement, accrual stops until the balance is reduced.

## 3. Requesting PTO
- **Procedure**: All PTO requests must be submitted through the HRIS (Workday/BambooHR) portal.
- **Notice Period**:
    - **Length < 3 days**: Notify manager at least 24 hours in advance.
    - **Length 3-5 days**: Notify manager at least 1 week in advance.
    - **Length > 1 week**: Notify manager at least 2 weeks in advance.
- **Approval**: Managers will approve requests based on team coverage and business needs. During peak periods (e.g., end of quarter), PTO may be restricted.

## 4. Carry Over and Payout

- **Expiration**: Carried-over days must be used by March 31st of the following year.
- **Separation**: Upon termination of employment (voluntary or involuntary), accrued but unused PTO will be paid out to the employee in their final paycheck, in accordance with state/local laws.

## 5. Sick Leave
